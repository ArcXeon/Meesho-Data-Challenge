# Product Attribute Classification

This repository contains the training and inference code for classifying product attributes into five categories:  
- **Sarees**  
- **Kurtis**  
- **Men's T-Shirts**  
- **Women's T-Shirts**  
- **Women's Tops and Tunics**  

The project leverages the PVTv2 (Pyramid Vision Transformer v2) model for attribute prediction based on product images.
